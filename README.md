# Linear-Regression-
Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between input features and a continuous target variable. In this task, we first import and preprocess the dataset, then split it into training and testing sets. Using Scikit-learnâ€™s LinearRegression, we train the model on the training data.
